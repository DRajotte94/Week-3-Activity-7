Program prompts user for integer input representing number of iterations through the forumla to calculate the value of pi
  - tryparse to determine input is a positive integer value
    - on parse fail send error message
  - for loop using the user input as the break point
    - taking mod 2 of iteration value to determine if even or odd
      - on even formula is added
      - on odd formula is subtracted
    -  y as second iterated variable (increased by 2) for use in formula
  - adds the user input to label2 for display
  - sends newly created value of pi to output label
